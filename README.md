# Temporal preservation metrics
This repository contains the source code for manuscript "Evaluation metrics for assessing temporal preservation in synthetic longitudinal patient data". 

To run the analyses on MIMIC-III using HALO and Health Gym GAN, you first need to obtain access to the MIMIC-III database via PhysioNet. After access is granted, run the original source code provided by the authors of HALO and Health Gym GAN. Next, execute the corresponding data preprocessing scripts included in this repository, followed by the main analysis scripts.

In addition, we provide demo data simulated from a parametric model that can be used to run the analyses without MIMIC-III access. This demo data was not used in, nor included in, the associated manuscript.
